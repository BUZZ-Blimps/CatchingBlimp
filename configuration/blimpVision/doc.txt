PI PASSWORD (if prompted): raspberry
Working directory on computer: /home/corelab-laptop2/GitHub/CatchingBlimp/blimpVision

Connecting to pi:
"ssh pi@192.168.0.10#" where # is pi ID

pushing code to pi:
"./copyCodeToPi.sh 192.168.0.10#" where # is pi ID 

check bashrc of pi
- ssh into pi
nano ~/.bashrc


TWO WAYS TO START PROGRAM:
	start the program on pi:
		- ssh into pi
		- navigate to piStereoVision/build
		"./piStereoVision"

		potential errors:
		- "can't open camera by index" -> likely that the camera is not plugged in. program won't run without camera. plug in the camera

	to start a blimp from the computer:
		"./restartProgram.sh 192.168.0.10#" where # is pi/blimp ID
		make sure you use BOTH arguments, first is IP of pi, second is blimp ID

BLIMP IDs:
	Raspberry Pis get their local IP address and use it as their blimp ID, by default.
	If desired, you can pass in an optional argument to the Pis code, which will override the blimp ID.
	
	Example - Default ID: 
		./piStereoVision
		OR
		./restartProgram.sh 192.168.0.10#

	Example - Override ID:
		./piStereoVision [ID]
		OR
		./restartProgram.sh 192.168.0.10# [ID]
