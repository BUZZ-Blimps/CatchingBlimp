CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:28 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findlibboost-dev.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "libboost-dev", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "libboost-dev" with
  any of the following names:

    libboost-devConfig.cmake
    libboost-dev-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "libboost-dev" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "libboost-dev_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "libboost-dev" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
