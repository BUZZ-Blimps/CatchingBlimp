CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:32 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findlibopencv-dev.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "libopencv-dev", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "libopencv-dev"
  with any of the following names:

    libopencv-devConfig.cmake
    libopencv-dev-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "libopencv-dev" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "libopencv-dev_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "libopencv-dev" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
