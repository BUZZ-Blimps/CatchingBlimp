PI PASSWORD (if prompted): raspberry
Working directory on computer: /home/corelab-laptop2/GitHub/CatchingBlimp/blimpVision

Connecting to pi:
"ssh pi@192.168.0.10#" where # is pi ID

pushing code to pi:
"./copyCodeToPi.sh 192.168.0.10#" where # is pi ID 

check bashrc of pi
- ssh into pi
nano ~/.bashrc


TWO WAYS TO START PROGRAM:
	start the program on pi:
		- s-sh into pi
		- navigate to piStereoVision/build
		"./piStereoVision #" where # is blimp ID


		potential errors:
		- "ID not provided." -> provide it an ID! pass the program its ID as the first argument
		- "can't open camera by index" -> likely that the camera is not plugged in. program won't run without camera. plug in the camera

	to start a blimp from the computer:
		"./restartProgram.sh 192.168.0.10# #" where # is pi/blimp ID
		make sure you use BOTH arguments, first is IP of pi, second is blimp ID
