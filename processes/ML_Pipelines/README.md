## Instructions

1. Make sure to zip the "ML_Pipeline" folder for training future datasets if no zip folder of that name already exists.

2. To create a new ML model, move into the "ML_Pipeline" folder and follow the README.md in that directory. If no folder exists, unzip the Zip Folder named "ML_Pipeline.zip".

3. After completing all steps to create your ML model, the "ML_Pipeline" directory should now be named "ML_Pipeline_COMPLETE" with the correct date and time on the end of the folder name. It is located in the "Completed" directory. The ML model is located in the folder named "7.ML_Model_Output" in your recently completed pipelines' directory.
